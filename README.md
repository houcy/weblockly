# Weblockly

### What is "Weblockly"?
"WebBlock" is a [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) Modification project, which enables students to make actual web site, creating HTML, CSS, Javascript(Using jQuery), so that students can run their Scratch project in web browser (or on a web server!).
We're planning to implement deployment feature, enalbing their project to be deployed on web server (such as Heroku, Google Cloud Platform, Firebase, but we're deciding which one to choose).

### How does this project works?
Blockly is an open source project(under Apache License v2.0). By taking advantage of [blockly](https://github.com/google/blockly) project, we were able to make Blockly App to Static Web Site Version.
