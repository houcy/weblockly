# Web From Scratch

### What is "Web From Scratch"?
"Web From Scratch" is a [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) Modification project, which enables Scratchers to make actual web site, creating HTML, CSS, Javascript(Using jQuery), so that Scratchers can run their Scratch project in web browser (or on a web server!).
We're planning to implement deployment feature, enalbing their project to be deployed on web server (such as Heroku, Google Cloud Platform, Firebase, but we're deciding which one to choose).

### How does this project works?
Scratch is an open source project(under GPLv2, GNU General Public License Version 2). By taking advantage of [scratch-vm](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-vm) project, and [scartch-blocks](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-blocks) project, we were able to make modification of Scratch to Static Web Site Version.
